Dinner was so good tonight I just have to share it. In living intentionally, Jacob and I have been trying to eat out less, eat more affordably, and use what we have on hand. We've been getting pretty creative with our dishes and it feels awesome! 
Here’s my take on a Spanish Breakfast Bibimbap. I used scrambled eggs but next time I will for sure go for a medium well egg to top it off!
  

# Ingredients
- 2 medium to large russet potatoes
- 1 small yellow onion
- 1 red bell pepper
- 1 green bell pepper
- 1 tbs. olive oil
- 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, cumin, salt, and pepper (or to taste)
- 5 tbs. butter
- 2 tbs. chipotles in adobo sauce, minced 
# Preparation
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. 
Dice potatoes, onions, and peppers into 1/2 inch cubes. In a large bowl, mix the potatoes, vegetables, olive oil, garlic powder, cumin, salt, and pepper. Set aside. 
In a large nonstick skillet, melt butter and add chipotle peppers. Infuse butter and peppers for 1-2 minutes. 
Add potatoes and veggies to skillet and sauté until golden brown and slightly tender (about 10 minutes).  
Transfer potatoes to a baking sheet and arrange in an even layer. Roast until potatoes are completely cooked and can be easily pierced by fork (about 15 minutes). 

Serve with all the breakfast fixins—eggs, bacon, sausage/chorizo and some Nana’s tortillas. Whatever you do, make sure to grab those tortillas…best flour tortillas you can buy from a grocery store!

You could also use these potatoes in a smoked sausage hash. These are not exclusive to breakfast and should be enjoyed often :)
