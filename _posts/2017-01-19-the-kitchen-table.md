#The Kitchen Table Well, tonight was a hard one. Now that I’m actively implementing minimalism in my life and sorting/cleaning/purging my junk daily, I got the bright idea that I wanted to go over our financial situation—just take a peek at what’s really going on there….. :| (<— this is what I look like right now as I type this post out).

You see, I understand that as I clean and minimize my clutter and spending habits, my financial situation (i.e. debts and expenses) needs the same devotion. Having a financial plan/goal is just as important as my house goals. BUT I just quit my job to stay with my 2-month old daughter and I’m sure that I still have some post-pregnancy hormones (yeah, we’ll blame it on that) so going over the budget hurt a little bit. I am doing this journey so that Jacob, Ivory, and I can live a better life that’s not surrounded by things but instead, surrounded by experiences and freedom. I’ve spent the better part of my adult life spending — new house, new cars, credit card debt, heck the bed I sleep on is financed. Now how can you have a good night’s rest on a mattress you don’t even own? So it hurts when I went through each debt tonight confronted with the fact that I spent my way into this situation and it won’t be as easy as throwing away/donating my “stuff” to get it out of (_wait, can I throw away my bills? Does it work like that? ;)_) Yeah, it’s going to take a lot of planning, selling, and prayer to get through the situation we’ve created for ourselves.

Honestly, part of me doesn’t want to post this. It’s a little too vulnerable to think that my family, friends, and peers are going to see that I don’t have stuff together—that I’ve put on this facade or worn some mask. Especially because I’m not in the promised land yet. It would be all too easy to post this once I have everything together, all the bills paid, living in Minimalists’ paradise. But I created this space to show my journey towards intentional living, minimalism, and the important things in my life. It seems disingenuous to not tell how hard tonight was. This is the journey. Neglecting this would be neglecting a huge chunk of the equation. I find encouragement to post this from Adam Baker in the below Ted Talk. Part of his talk that struck a hard chord with me was”

> “The year between the kitchen table and this picture was a tough one. We had to analyze a lot of things and look inside at a picture of ourselves that wasn’t the one we wanted people to see, it wasn’t the one we projected. We had to change a lot of habits, a lot of beliefs in order to get there, but we were able to do it.“ This instantly rang true in my life. I don’t want my family and friends to see me struggle or wonder, “why are they selling all their stuff??” but at the end of the day, these actions are necessary to move towards a place of freedom and change. I guess I can’t apologize for that or try to hide it.

So here I sit typing… in my living room, on my couch, next to my daughter thinking about how we’re going to get from “here” to “there” in our financial goals. Completely vulnerable to the thoughts and criticisms (and more likely, encouragements) of our family and loved ones. At the end of the day (or year…or years :S), I know this will all be worth it. Heck, I only have to glance to my left to know that it’s going to be worth it and that we’re making decisions now that will impact Ivory’s life for the much much better. I guess I can rest easy knowing the temporary pain today will increase her life exponentially. So come on, budget, I’m ready for ya…
