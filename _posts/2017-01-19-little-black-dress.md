I made vast improvements on my bedroom yesterday. Closet weeded down to a handful of dresses, drawers emptied and sorted (two are still emptied and not refilled! woohoo!), shoes lined up—I’m mindful about creating a home for everything I keep. I have a huge pile of things to donate/sell.

As I went through the process of elimination, I had minimalism Youtube videos playing in the background as a constant reminder to ask myself, *Does it bring me joy? Do I have too many of these (I see you, leggings!)? Have I worn it recently? Why do I want to hold onto it?*Usually, if I had even a doubt about it, into the donation pile it went. Except for…

# The Little Black Dress

They say every woman should own a little black dress and in my ~excessive~ overachieving mindset I own a half dozen or more. So when I was weeding through my closet and found one of them that I really liked, I just knew I had to keep it. I tried it on as I was doing with all the clothes and here’s how the inner battle began…

**first impression**: well my legs look great in it but the way the dress hangs is a little funny…  
**reasoning**: I’ll just wear it with a jean jacket.  
**rebuttal**: You have *too *many dresses where you have to “just wear a jean jacket with it”  
**reasoning**: but my legs.  
**rebuttal**: but the top of it looks worn and isn’t flattering.  
**reasoning**: But I really loved this dress. I’m going to keep it and if I don’t wear it in 6 months then I’ll toss it.

*(Please tell me you guys have these inner dialogues too? Typing it out made me feel like a crazy person but that’s legit how it went) *

That felt reasonable. If I didn’t wear this dress in the next few months, I’ll know that it wasn’t a good match and would donate it. Done deal—decision made and onto the hanger it went! I continued on my merry way, keeping and tossing…tossing and keeping… but something about that black dress was bugging me. Why couldn’t I let it go? It didn’t hold any intrinsic sentimental value to me. It was just another black dress. If that’s true, then why was I keeping it in the first place?

# Ruthless Decision Making

I hate to sound verbose or flowery in how I describe this journey to you, but I have had a true conversion on the “stuff” in my life. All of a sudden, within the past month, a lightbulb went on and I realized all the stuff I owned was 1) not bringing me happiness 2) stressing me out 3) making me financially anemic 4) limiting my creative ability 5) owning me.

I “own” far too many things that I need to de-clutter them from my life. I’ve seen a lot of posts and advice saying, “get rid of one thing a day for a month”. If I took the above approach, it would take me approximately 41 years and 3 months to get rid of the stuff necessary to live in peace. That’s not my journey. It’s definitely helpful for someone dipping their toes in minimalism but I’ve already CANNON BALL!ed myself into those decluttering waters. When looking and keeping my items, I have to be ruthless. Does it add value to my life? Does it bring me joy? Does it bring me closer to my goals and dreams? Do I look good in it? If the answer to any of these is no, I have to toss it.

So there I went — grabbed the dress and hesitantly took it off the hanger. Before I had a chance to reason with myself, I tossed it in the donation pile. (Real life: Actually I stuck it in the donation pile and topped it with other items so I wouldn’t go back in and try to re-hang it in my closet :S) A small, ruthless victory!

So many times decluttering is about taking things away from our lives. For me personally, I’ve been intently focusing on what will be added to my life if these objects weren’t in it… less cleaning so more relaxation, aesthetic enjoyment, less stress, more money!, unleashed creativity. It’s with this mindset that I continue my journey. Onto the next bedroom…did I mention it has boxes full of clothes from when we moved :S God be with me!

Sayonara, little black dress!
