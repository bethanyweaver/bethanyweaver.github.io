This is a favorite around our house. So much so, I permanently have the recipe posted on our fridge for quick reference…

This comes from Get In My Belly’s [recipe video tutorial] and I don’t deter from any of the ingredients. The only changes I make is if the sauce is too thick/thin I’ll increase my chicken stock to cream ratio. If we’re being creative though, the addition of bacon crumbles might not be too hateful (am I right???? ;)).

Onto the dish….

# Ingredients

<br> 2 tbs. olive oil

<br> 1 1/2 lbs. chicken breasts (about 4 chicken breasts)

<br> salt and pepper

<br> 1 cup heavy cream

<br> 1/2 cup chicken broth

<br> 1 tsp. garlic powder

<br> 1 tsp. Italian seasoning

<br> 1 cup parmesan cheese, divided into 1/2 cup measurements

<br> 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes
