I have been giving myself extra dosages of encouragement lately when it comes to minimalism — not because I’m discouraged or overwhelmed; simply, because I realize just how important this decision is in my life…How much I want and am willing to make a minimalist approach to work.

I’ve been surrounded by chaos and “things” for years with no relief. This shows up in every area of my life:

*   Cooking - I passionately enjoy cooking, just not the rigamarole that I’ve created for myself. Navigating through teetering pots and pans, excessive unused kitchen gadgets, bounties of low-quality utensils… anyone want to order a pizza instead?
*   Creative expression - Do you know how hard it is to think—let alone, create—in a space that is stuffed with “stuff”? Impossible.
*   Spending time with family - It’s difficult to invite people over when you know it requires a minimum of an hour cleaning and hiding all of your stuff. Am I right?
*   Peace - When you surround yourself with stuff you forsake peace in every sense. Not only is their a lack of aesthetic peace but the peace among family members leaves too. Chaos begets chaotic emotions and experiences. I don’t know how many times Jacob and I have gotten into a fight after searching high and low for something we couldn’t find in our house. Taking the chaos out of the mix invites peace back into your home.

These are just a few things I want to gain as I take back my life and space. Through intentional and thoughtful action, I am daily making steps toward that goal. If you’re needing some encouragement, here are some things I’ve been listening to:
