Now that I’m staying at home with Ivory, I realize how dangerous FoodNetwork and HGTV are. By the time Jacob comes home I’ve menu planned for a month and have a half dozen diy projects for us to start. I really should cut the plug on these shoes—BUT. I. CAN’T. (addiction, much?).

That being said, this week I was watching Ina Garten’s Chicken 101 episode where she made [Engagement Chicken](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/engagement-roast-chicken-recipe.html). This was my first attempt at Roasted Chicken (I know, where have I been the last 26 years???) and I’d say overall it was successful! The chicken, itself, was scrumptious but I found the gravy to be very bitter and inedible. A lot of reviewers on the recipe said the same thing so I went into it knowing it was a possibility. That being said, next time I will just do the chicken and onions and maybe add some potatoes or other vegetables. The lemon stuffed in the chicken can stay but the rest gotta go! :) I can’t wait to use this chicken for leftovers.

Here is Ina’s [recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/engagement-roast-chicken-recipe.html) if you’d like to give it a try yourself. I also have it below (sans gravy steps).

# Ingredients

1 (4 to 5 pound) whole chicken  
Kosher salt and black pepper  
1/2 lemon  
1 whole head garlic, halved  
Olive oil  
2 yellow onions, thickly sliced  
Bakers twine  
Roasting Pan

# Preparation

*   Heat oven to 425 degrees.
*   Remove and discard the chicken giblets and any loose bones in the chicken (mine came with some in the cavity. You can freeze these and use for chicken stock later).
*   Cut lemon in half and then cut one half in half again (say that ten times fast!) and save the other half for another use. If you wanted to, you could use all the lemon in the cavity—personal choice :).
*   Cut garlic in half crosswise (you’ll now have the top and bottom)
*   Slice yellow onions and set aside in large bowl.
*   Slice any other vegetables you plan on using (carrots, potatoes, etc.) and add to onions.

# Directions

**Chicken** Pat the chicken dry. Then, drizzle olive oil (1-2 tbs.) over chicken and rub it in. Sprinkle salt and pepper over chicken and give that a good rub, as well. In the chicken cavity, sprinkle more salt and pepper. Add the lemon and the garlic pieces. Tie the legs of the chicken together and tuck the wings underneath the chicken (nothing fancy here!). Place chicken in a roasting pan (mine was a disposable pan - 11x13 size). 

**Vegetables** Drizzle 2 tbs olive oil over vegetable mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Add mixture to roasting pan around the chicken.

Bake at 425 degrees for 1 hour and 15 minutes then check to see if it is done. It will be done when you poke between the leg and thigh and the juice is clear. My bird was just over 5 pounds and took about 1 hour and 35 minutes to cook through. Once juices run clear, let the chicken rest for 10 minutes.

Can't you just see how bitter those lemons look? #neveragain

If you’re anything like me, you have no idea how to carve a chicken. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnwyQLYTw8E), it helped me.

# Leftovers

I think I’m more excited for leftovers than I am for the roasted chicken. We will reserve the chicken breasts for Creamy Tuscan Garlic Chicken and the leftover dark meat for Chicken Fried Rice
