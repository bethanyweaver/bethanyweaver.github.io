Three words have been rolling across my mind in looking toward this year: 

1. Intentional
2. Authenticity 
3. Cherish

I’m going to dedicate a post to each word so let’s start with the big one. 

Intentionality is my favorite way to describe new year’s resolutions and really any change that I am seeking. It first came to my periphery several years ago when I read the quote, 

> That was the day she made herself the promise to live more from intention and less from habit.

I have so many habits I’ve picked up over the years — and not good ones — I’m messy, undisciplined (hello shoes in the center of the room), a huge spender (goodbye paycheck, I never even saw you), I’m too mean short with my husband, and I have unfinished projects strewn all over my house usually in some embarrassing, disheveled pile. Indeed I have some very bad habits … but I don’t want those to define me. I want to break out of habitual living and step into intentional living. 

I have many things I want to accomplish this year that I’m very excited about (see Intentional Living post). When I set goals for myself, my habit is to immediately come in and sprinkle some self-doubt all over that long list. I have no idea how to pursue something with complete abandon. My mind instantly goes to a “devil’s advocate” place. *Oh, you want to start a garden this year? What happened to that goal last year? Oh and the year before that? You killed all those beautiful strawberry seedlings and neglected those peppers until your dog ate it*. (Can you tell I’m dealing with some stuff here?) But instead of getting overwhelmed and discouraged, I am trying to take a new approach to my goals—an intentional one. For instance, when I decided I wanted to plant a garden at our new house, my mind easily named off a dozen or more things I wanted to plant — far too many for someone who is new to gardening and has no idea what she’s doing. So I asked myself, *What wold we utilize most? What would actually be doable? *Now I have a paired down list that will take less time/money to research, buy, plant, and care for. 
I am totally questioning my standard quo of carelessly buying things, spending without cause, or heaping unfinished projects into a corner. I want to thoughtfully pursue interesting projects. I want to spend my time and money more wisely this year. I mean, we have to. As a stay at home wife/mom now, we only have Jacob’s income. I want to be a good steward of that. 
I love putting what I’m feeling on paper (or keyboard?). It’s therapeutic and steadies my hand to the plow. It allows me to slow down (because writing takes longer than thinking) and really consider what’s been tumbling around in my heart and mind. Even as I write this, doubt tries to creep in—*how are you going to do everything you’ve planned for this year? You won’t succeed, look at your track record of unfinished projects. *To those voices I don’t say, “watch me” or “I’ll prove you wrong” or worse — “you’re right, I should give up”. To that voice (and to yours if you’re feeling like-minded), I say:
> Be still. What will be, will be but I choose to intentionally seek after the good things today. I want to increase my life and my family’s life. Even if today’s step is small it is leading me through an intentional, mighty, and authentic life. 

And it’s never a bad thing to throw in an amen at the end :)

# Authenticity

 Authenticity is the second word that I have been mulling over as I start this new year. In fact, it is actually a resolution carried over from last year and will probably be included in every year going forward. It really came to me out of necessity. 
 
I hate feeling jealous or envious of another person. It makes me feel so ungrateful for all the blessings I have in life but I have often found myself (usually while scrolling through Facebook) comparing my situation to the highlights happening with my friends, family, or peers. Each time I saw something stellar happening for a friend, a little dart of self-doubt would shoot at an area in my life — my career choices, financial situation, physical attributes, personality, confidence, inability to go on extravagant adventures like I really wanted to (yeah I see your post about swimming with dolphins in the Bahamas and traveling to third world countries to mission….okay, simmer down envy!). When you see the best part of someone’s life scrolling in front of you, it can make you seriously question your own, even if you have a wonderful life with an amazing husband and daughter and incredible passions and experiences. 
It was in this self-doubt and lack of confidence that Facebook bestowed this wonderful gift to me, an [article](http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-14009/20-habits-of-highly-authentic-people.html) on the habits of highly authentic people. The word itself resonated deeply with me. What did it mean to be *authentic*? I started to surround myself with quotes and articles about authenticity. Here is what I have (and still discover) on my progress to authenticity:
Living authentically means being truly you and truly vulnerable no matter what company you’re in. To me, authenticity means being content in who I am, what I have, and what I’m striving for in life. My journey is my own so I want to embrace that journey for myself and applaud and encourage you on yours. I want to be kind and sincere and confident and creative. I want to inspire authenticity in my friends and family and allow them the freedom to be themselves as imperfect as they are because I know that I am equally imperfect. 
Authenticity begets gratitude. If I’m content with who I am on my path then I don’t need to tear you down or belittle you because I envy your position or life (we’ve all done it, even if the words are never spoken aloud). This leads me to my third resolve: cherish. 
# Cherish 
The other day I heard the word cherish and it gave me one of those super cool, tickle-your-ears sort of feelings. I knew it was going to be something God would speak to me about this year. It’s not a word we hear often enough, reserved mostly for wedding vows. When we’re speaking to loved ones, we opt for words and phrases like “I’m grateful for you”, “I love you”, and “I appreciate you”. When was the last time you told someone that you *cherish *them? For me, I can’t even think of an example. Was it my wedding day? Yes, when I heard the word *cherish *, it sank deep into my soul. 
To cherish something goes beyond the surface of emotion and feeling and enters into that world of intention (can you see how interconnected my resolutions are this year?). One definition of [cherish](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cherish) is “to keep or cultivate with care and affection.” In my life, I want to cherish my husband and daughter. I want to invest in them and to nurture them with my time, energy, thoughts, and prayers. I want to intentionally serve them and reflect on my gratitude for them. I want to hold dear the moments I have with my little newborn. Everyone keeps telling me it goes by quickly—too quickly—and I want to do everything in my power to savor these moments with her. I want to treasure my husband both as an awesome, loving partner and as a truly wonderful and capable father. I want to speak life into him and encourage him in his pursuits. I value him so much and I don’t want day-to-day life or the grumppies to get in the way of him feeling truly cherished. 
Here’s a final thought to soak our minds in today: 
> If you want something to last forever, you treat it differently. You shield it and protect it. You never abuse it. You don’t expose it to the elements. You don’t make it common or ordinary. If it ever becomes tarnished, you lovingly polish it until it gleams like new. It becomes special because you have made it so, and it grows more beautiful and precious as time goes by.

Cherish the treasures in your life…today.
