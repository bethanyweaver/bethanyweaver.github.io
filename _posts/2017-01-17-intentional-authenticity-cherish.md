Three words have been rolling across my mind in looking toward this year.  

1.  Intentional
2.  [Authentic](http://bethanygearee.com/2017/01/06/authenticity.html)
3.  [Cherish](http://bethanygearee.com/2017/01/07/cherish.html){:style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); letter-spacing: 0.01em;"}

These words are completely interconnected to what I want to see in my life, relationships, and goals this year. Each depends on the other for me to have true success. So as to not ramble too long, <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">I’m going to dedicate a post to each word so let’s start with the big one.</span>

**Intentionality** is my favorite way to describe new year’s resolutions and really any change that I am seeking. It first came to my periphery several years ago when I read the quote,

> That was the day she made herself the promise to live more from intention and less from habit.

I have so many habits I’ve picked up over the years — and not good ones — I’m messy, undisciplined (hello shoes in the center of the room), a huge spender (goodbye paycheck, I never even saw you), I’m too ~mean~ short with my husband, and I have unfinished projects strewn all over my house usually in some embarrassing, disheveled pile. Indeed I have some very bad habits … but I don’t want those to define me. I want to break out of habitual living and step into intentional living.

# The Garden

I have many things I want to accomplish this year that I’m very excited about. When I set goals for myself, my habit is to immediately come in and sprinkle some self-doubt all over that long list. I have no idea how to pursue something with complete abandon. My mind instantly goes to a “devil’s advocate” place. _Oh, you want to start a garden this year? What happened to that goal last year? Oh and the year before that? You killed all those beautiful strawberry seedlings and neglected those peppers until your dog ate it_. (Can you tell I’m dealing with some stuff here?) But instead of getting overwhelmed and discouraged, I am trying to take a new approach to my goals—an intentional one. For instance, when I decided I wanted to plant a garden at our new house, my mind easily named off a dozen or more things I wanted to plant — far too many for someone who is new to gardening and has no idea what she’s doing. So I asked myself, *What wold we utilize most? What would actually be doable? *Now I have a paired down list that will take less time/money to research, buy, plant, and care for.

In taking this new, intentional approach, I am totally questioning my standard quo of carelessly buying things, spending without cause, or heaping unfinished projects into a corner. I am trying to thoughtfully pursue interesting projects. I want to spend my time and money more wisely this year. I mean, we have to. As a stay at home wife/mom now, we only have Jacob’s income. I want to be a good steward of that.

# Enter Blog.

I love putting what I’m feeling on paper (or keyboard?). It’s therapeutic and steadies my hand to the plow. It allows me to slow down (because writing takes longer than thinking) and really consider what’s been tumbling around in my heart and mind. I hate to say this blog is accountability. Really it's a journal of the amazing things that are taking place in my life lately. But yeah, let's say it's accountability, too. Because even as I write this post, doubt is trying to creep in—*how are you going to do everything you’ve planned for this year? You won’t succeed, look at your track record of unfinished projects. *To those voices I don’t say, “watch me” or “I’ll prove you wrong” or worse — “you’re right, I should give up”. To that voice (and to yours if you’re feeling like-minded), I say:

> Be still. What will be, will be but I choose to intentionally seek after the good things today. I want to increase my life and my family’s life. Even if today’s step is small it is leading me through an intentional, mighty, and authentic life.

And it’s never a bad thing to throw in an amen at the end :)
