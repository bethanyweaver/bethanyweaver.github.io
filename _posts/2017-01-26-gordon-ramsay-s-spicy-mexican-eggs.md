It’s no secret—or maybe it is?—my husband has a man crush on Gordon Ramsay. I think he’s even going to start styling his hair like him—yeah, he told me that; I’m not making it up. But who can blame him? Dreamy locks aside, the man makes some great food!

# *Enter Spicy Mexican Eggs. *

This dinner was delicious—part of our #kitchenadventures commitment to test, cook, and eat things we’ve not tried before. This gets a solid A so we will be adding this to the Golden Recipe Box (check it out!). Let’s jump right into it!

If you’re a visual learner like me, go ahead and check out Gordon’s video on how to make this dish. If not, feel free to keep reading on.

# Ingredients
1 tbs. olive oil  
1 small red onion, diced  
1 jalapeno, sliced  
3 garlic cloves, sliced  
1 tsp. cumin  
1 14oz. can tomatoes (I used crushed tomatoes but diced would be fine)  
1 14oz. can black beans, rinsed  
4-6 corn tortillas (depending on how big your casserole dish is)  
5-6 eggs (depending on how big your casserole dish is)  
1/2 cup white cheddar cheese, finely grated  
1/2 tsp. crush red pepper  
Chopped cilantro, garnish  
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

# Preparation

*   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
*   Add olive oil to sauté pan (don’t heat yet, finish preparing the rest of your ingredients).
*   Dice red onion and through in large bowl.
*   Thinly slice jalapeno and garlic and add to onion bowl.
*   Measure 1 tsp. cumin.
*   Open tomato and black bean cans.
*   Drain and rinse black beans, set aside.
*   Grease casserole dish with a little olive oil.
*   Grab corn tortillas and eggs, set aside next to your casserole dish.
*   Finely grate 1/2 cup of white cheddar cheese.
*   Measure out 1/2 tsp crush red pepper (or to taste).
*   Chop cilantro for garnish (or avoid it altogether if you’re a cilantro-hater like me ;))
*   Have salt and pepper ready.

# Directions

Heat olive oil on medium heat. Once hot, add red onions, jalapeños, and garlic.  
Sauté until onions are translucent and a little brown.  
Season with cumin, salt, and pepper (to taste).  
Add tomatoes and cook for about 5 minutes. Note: I used crushed tomatoes and they worked splendidly. You could used petite diced tomatoes (which I believe is what Gordon is using in his video).  
Add black beans and cook 2-3 more minutes.  
Taste and adjust seasonings as necessary.  
Take pan off the heat and grab your casserole dish and corn tortillas.  
Arrange corn tortillas in your casserole dish so that they overlap slightly, hang off the edge of the dish, and cover the bottom of the dish (see Gordon’s tutuorial). Gordon cut his in half but I kept mine whole and they were perfect.  
Spoon the tomato/onion/bean mixture into the tortilla-lined casserole dish.  
Creating little wells, crack each egg and pour into well. I had 5 total.  
Top with more salt and pepper, the white cheddar cheese and crush red pepper.  
Bake for 15 minutes at 350 degrees, making sure the the egg white is completely cooked. If still clear, continue cooking until white.  
Top with chopped cilantro (if that's your thing)

# Serving Suggestion:

Top with crumbled chorizo and baked tortilla triangles. I ate this with leftover chipotle-butter steak bites and [spanish potatoes](http://bethanygearee.com/2017/01/20/spanish-breakfast-bibimbap.html).
