<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Minimalism is a dirty word to many. Some unattainable, overwhelming bachelor-living inspired sentiment that every day people with families can’t even hope to attain. And why would they want to? You need the stuff you’ve chosen to put in your home? You’ve spent hard earned money for those things and they add value to your home and life…_right_? For me, when I asked myself the same questions I felt myself screaming no, flailing under an ocean of “stuff”. Here’s my journey toward seeking minimalism for my life.</span>

# STARTING SOMEWHERE.

Right now as it stands (and if you looked at my house), I am NOT a minimalist. I want to get all of this out on the table (amongst all the piles of crap) so you don’t presume I’m somebody that I’m not. I want to be real with everyone on this journey I’m taking and right now I’m in the beginning. Therefore, I have piles of junk everywhere. I have mounds of clothes and fabric and home decor that hasn’t ever seen life outside of a garage. My husband would say I have a serious mild case of hoarding if I’m even being the least bit honest. Yes, I am a mess…my house is a mess…and I have a ton of stuff.

So what authority do I have to talk about minimalism? Honestly, absolutely none. I have just now started this journey on removing the “surplus” in my life because I want to live a happier life. Here’s my story and how I got to this point.

My husband and I started our joined-lives in a 1080 square foot home that my dad had previously owned. I had already lived there for several years before my husband came into the mix. I’d like to say that him moving in added to the chaos but it was already there when he arrived and he really didn’t do anything to add to it. Over the next three years and making semi-decent money, I made it my mission to fill that house up till it was busting at the seams. When people would come over (never unexpectedly or else I’d have a real panic attack), I’d have to rage clean and throw all my piles of stuff into baskets that I would stash in the bedrooms which were already full of other baskets of clutter. Having people over was a real chore to mask my accumulation.

So what was the solution?

# BUY A BIGGER HOUSE.

Jacob and I decided to move a half an hour south to be a little closer to his work. What was our wishlist for the new place? MORE SPACE, naturally. We were expecting our first child and kids take up tons of space, ya know? (not to mention all of the space mama needed for her “necessities”). So, we settled on a quiet suburb, with a pretty two-story that was double the size of our current home. Now we had 2000+ square feet to work with — surely that would be enough, right? You guessed it, it wasn’t enough! Within a couple months, the place was full and my garage was inaccessible (which was pretty embarrassing when my brother in law peeked in there without me first being able to give a warning or at least an explanation…Like there really was one???). Now I’m talking in the past tense but my garage is still filled to the brim and I still have rooms full but I want you guys to see where I’m at and where I’m coming from. Maybe you can relate to me and see where I’m coming from and what has led me to this. It is basically out of necessity and a desire for something more.

# MINIMALISM IS MORE.

I haven’t taken this decision lightly or in a fire of excitement. This isn’t a little project that I think would be “fun to give it a try” only to end up in the corner of some room (hello, yards upon yards of unrealized fabric potential in my craft hoard). I have thoughtfully and intentionally come to this decision of minimizing after many encouragements and confirmations upon confirmations. You see, I’ve spent thousands of dollars (and hours) on the hunt for purchasing my happiness. Feeling a bit down? Go to Target. Stressed out because of all these hospital bills (my $6000 baby!), go spend money you don’t have at Marshalls. Constantly on the hunt to fill my heart, mind, and house with material happiness. It hasn’t worked. Instead I’ve traded my hard-earned money (and time) for a collection of untouched things in stagnant piles in unusable rooms. I have nothing to show for it. So I’m changing that. With minimalism you exchange chaos with intention—purposefully selecting what you want in your life and home. I’ve decided that I’m exchanging the piles of clothes, unfinished projects, and home decor hoard for personal and professional creativity, freedom, and peace in my home. I’m exchanging material excess for life-inspired abundance. Now doesn’t that sound like fun? Join me?
