 Authenticity is the second word that I have been mulling over as I start this new year. In fact, it is actually a resolution carried over from last year and will probably be included in every year going forward. It really came to me out of necessity.

I hate feeling jealous or envious of another person. It makes me feel so ungrateful for all the blessings I have in life but I have often found myself (usually while scrolling through Facebook) comparing my situation to the highlights happening with my friends, family, or peers. Each time I saw something stellar happening for a friend, a little dart of self-doubt would shoot at an area in my life — my career choices, financial situation, physical attributes, personality, confidence, inability to go on extravagant adventures like I really wanted to (yeah I see your post about swimming with dolphins in the Bahamas and traveling to third world countries to mission….okay, simmer down envy!). When you see the best part of someone’s life scrolling in front of you, it can make you seriously question your own, even if you have a wonderful life with an amazing husband and daughter and incredible passions and experiences.

It was in this self-doubt and lack of confidence that Facebook bestowed this wonderful gift to me, an [article] on the habits of highly authentic people. The word itself resonated deeply with me. What did it mean to be *authentic*? I started to surround myself with quotes and articles about authenticity. Here is what I have (and still discover) on my progress to authenticity:

Living authentically means being truly you and truly vulnerable no matter what company you’re in. To me, authenticity means being content in who I am, what I have, and what I’m striving for in life. My journey is my own so I want to embrace that journey for myself and applaud and encourage you on yours. I want to be kind and sincere and confident and creative. I want to inspire authenticity in my friends and family and allow them the freedom to be themselves as imperfect as they are because I know that I am equally imperfect.

Authenticity begets gratitude. If I’m content with who I am on my path then I don’t need to tear you down or belittle you because I envy your position or life (we’ve all done it, even if the words are never spoken aloud). This leads me to my third resolve: cherish.
